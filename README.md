Project Title: A classification approach to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving a company.

This project showcases a machine learning classification model built to predict likelihood of an employee leaving a company using a HR employee attrition dataset collected off Kaggle.
The model utilizes various supervised learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and KNN, to classify the data accurately.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Modeling: Comparison of multiple classification algorithms with hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation: Model performance measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
Visualization: Plot for correlation matrix, Histogram, Dataset summary table/final results table.
